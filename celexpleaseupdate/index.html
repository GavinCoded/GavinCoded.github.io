        <p>It's been 3 days, 14 hours, 1 minute, and 23 seconds since the love of my life C3l3x was unrightfully stripped away from me and many more lovers like myself of C3l3x. I can already feel my anger rising with the understanding my body is coming to a slow death. Without C3l3x, I'm nothing. C3l3x means everything. I skip school daily to play for 17 hours a day with C3l3x. I planned on living with C3l3x. Without it, I'm lost and I don't know how to move forward. C3l3x means everything to me. All my money, time, and care go to it, and for it to be taken away has me at a loss for words.</p>
        <p>This is something the world will never get over. Millions have been affected, and at this point, millions have died within themselves as the only thing we've grown to love is gone in a snap. This is something I don't think I can get past as I have not stepped foot out of my house and live off my mom since the last 3 years. Nothing can match this game, and nothing can replace what it meant to me. It's like I have to restart life, and I don't think I can carry on with life like this.</p>
        <p>C3l3x was my life. Even before I binged played with it for 18 hours a day, I was playing on my laptop in school until I got my mommy to let me drop out of 6th grade and commit my life to using C3l3x. I can't see how it's viewed as fair to simply take my life away. I don't know if I can live with it. I've spent hours finding how to become the best. I have spent thousands on this. I've been crying since it was banned. I spent almost 10 hours a day on making and trying to get better configs. This is something the world can't oversee. As far as I know, this is the end of the world. I assume in 24 hours, we will all be dead from ourselves or others in fear of the loss of C3l3x.</p>
